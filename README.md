# Influencer_Detection

Each datapoint describes two individuals. Pre-computed, standardised features based on twitter activity (such as volume of interactions, number of followers, etc) is provided for each individual.
The discrete label represents a human judgement about which one of the two individuals is more influential. The goal of the challenge is to train a machine learning model which, for a pair of individuals, predicts the human judgement on who is more influential with high accuracy. 

The dataset  was taken from a kaggle challenge "Influencers in Social Networks".
